If you receive income weekly, a good estimate is to multiply that number by 52 then divide by 12. The formula is (paycheck amount) x (number of paychecks in a year) / 12. Do this for each of your income streams. If you have variable income, use the smallest amount you think you'd receive. We'll deal with excess income later."

Many recurring expenses are fixed but some are variable. You may need to look at your credit card statements or receipts to estimate how much you spend on these on average, but an approximate is good enough here. This is a budget so it's *forward-looking*. You're deciding how much you'd like to spend on these moving forward. In some sense, what you spent in the past is irrelevant apart from informing how realistic your goal is.\n\nCategories are optional, but make for fun pie charts later on.
